Predictive Maintenance task comparison using a Quantized MOA Version on a Microprocessor
============

Optional project of the [Streaming Data Analytics](http://emanueledellavalle.org/teaching/streaming-data-analytics-2023-24/) course provided by [Politecnico di Milano](https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/schedaincarico/schedaincarico/controller/scheda_pubblica/SchedaPublic.do?&evn_default=evento&c_classe=811164&polij_device_category=DESKTOP&__pj0=0&__pj1=d563c55e73c3035baf5b0bab2dda086b).

Student: **[To be assigned]**

The project will use the Java library tinyMOA-lite1 on a Raspberry Pi simulator to solve a classification task. The aim is to train several models on tinyMOA-lite on a Raspberry Pi simulator and to compare their performance w.r.t. the relative models trained on River and MOA.

More in practice, for the AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset2, you have to train and test the Na√Øve Bayes, KNN, HT, HAT, ARF, Online Bagging, Leveraging Bagging, ARF, and SRP models in tinyMOA-lite on a Raspberry Pi simulator, and in MOA and River on your Pc.
About the data ingestion to the Raspberry Pi, follow the way it was done in the master thesis.

You should use the following metrics to compare the results: Accuracy, Balanced Accuracy, Geometric Mean, and CohenKappa

Moreover, you should keep track of the Time, CPU and RAM usage to test and train the models. The project must also include some plots to better show the results.

You are required to create a .sh or .java file with the code for testing the models in tinyMOA-lite and MOA, and a .py or .ipynb file for testing the models in River. All the results must be collected in a .ipynb file to be compared. You must include comments for the principal instructions, and you are allowed to import external py modules. Additionally, ensure you thoroughly comment on the comparison results using various plots associated with the different metrics. Finally, again, in the final .ipynb file, briefly discuss the conclusions that can be drawn from the experiment.

We will give you the tinyMOA-lite code after signing an NDA disclosure.
